# Description:

Dashboard Admin page created utilizing the syncfusion libs(@syncfusion/ej2) and tailwindcss. 

Available on: https://adm-dashboard.netlify.app

Its a pretty interesting feature that facilitates the creation of a dashboard with a calendar, kanban, tables, charts and other components. The only problem with the syncfusion lib is that it is a paid library, so I cannot implement the Application further after the trial. 

I took the Dummy.js from another project with the data based on the syncfusion lib.
